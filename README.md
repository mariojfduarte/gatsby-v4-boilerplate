  Gatsby's v4 starter
</h1>

A boilerplate to kick off any Gatsby project. This starter ships with:

- Emotion JS (with access to Material UI custom theme)
- React redux (with reduxjs/toolkit)
- React intl for multilingual support
- React helmet for SEO

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone repo.**

    ```shell
    # clone repo
    git clone <report-address>
    ```
    
1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-v4-boilerplate/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-4/#use-graphiql-to-explore-the-data-layer-and-write-graphql-queries)._

    Open the `my-hello-world-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
